# Software Design Description document template
A template for Software Design Description documents based on IEEE Std 1016TM-2009, and ISO/IEC/IEEE:42010. Most of the language is taken directly from the listed documents with minor additions taken from [Taylor et al.'s Software Architecture: Foundations, Theory, and Practice](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Software+Architecture%3A+Foundations%2C+Theory%2C+and+Practice-p-9780470167748)

The markdown format is based on [rick4470's template](https://github.com/rick4470/IEEE-SRS-Tempate) which is based on IEEE 830.

There's also a [Software Requirements Specification Template](https://github.com/jam01/SRS-Template)
